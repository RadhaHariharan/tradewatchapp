Flutter App for tradewatch recuritment process.

Steps to run
1. Clone the project
2. run flutter pub get command from terminal
3. go to server folder
4. in terminal type npm run start and press enter
5. now in stocksController.dart replace the IP in the URL with the IP of the system running the server.
6. Now run the app in debug mode and check.

Didn't implement 1D in chart as the package was not returning data in time series.


I have used extensions on the application which will dynamically adapt to the screen size and change the font size container height and width.
Some of the other things which can be improved is splitting the view folder widgets into sub widgets for greater readibility. I haven't implemented the other screens as I think that was not required for the situation.

Thanks and Regards
